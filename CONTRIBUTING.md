- All contributions must go through a pull request and require at least one approval.
- Direct pushes to the `main` branch are not allowed.

## Security Practices

We take security seriously. To ensure contributions do not introduce vulnerabilities or malicious payloads, please follow these security guidelines:

1. **Code Scanning**: All pull requests will be automatically scanned for security vulnerabilities using tools like [CodeQL](https://github.com/github/codeql).
2. **Signed Commits**: To verify the identity of contributors, we recommend signing your commits using Git‚Äôs GPG signing feature.
3. **Review Process**: Every pull request will be manually reviewed by maintainers before merging.
4. **No Binary Files**: Do not upload binary files (e.g., `.exe`, `.dll`) or any precompiled code. This helps prevent potential security risks.
5. **Respect `.gitignore`**: Ensure sensitive files like environment variables or credentials (e.g., `.env` files) are not committed.
6. **Dependabot Alerts**: Vulnerabilities in dependencies will be automatically flagged and addressed before merging.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover any security vulnerabilities in the project, please report them privately by emailing [kaival@neopric.com]. Do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities until we have had the chance to investigate and address them.
